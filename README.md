# NES-Power-Board
A PCB that will fit in place of the stock NES frontloader's RF module.
This is a fork of of Mathew's original NES Power board, https://github.com/mspinksosu/NES-Power-Board
***
This PCB will replace the stock RF modulator box. It will have different connector options for outputting audio and video, as well as a breakout for the channel select switch.

I plan to support:
* composite video with mono audio
* composite video and "stereo" audio (standard 3 RCA TV connection)
* RGB + composite using a Retrofixes SNES style multiout connector.  (Requires existing RGB mod) This will be my version.
* RGB output directly to the Framemeister's 8-pin mini DIN connector. (Requires existing RGB mod)

The first two options require no modification to the chassis. All other versions will require some chassis modification, but it will minimal.

This PCB is designed specifically with Tim Worthington's NESRGB board in mind. The channel select switch will have a breakout so that it can be used as a palette selector switch.
